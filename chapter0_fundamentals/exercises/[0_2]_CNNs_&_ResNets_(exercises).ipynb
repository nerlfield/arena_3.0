    "This is not exactly the case for the Kaiming uniform distribution (which has variance $\\frac{12}{(2 \\sqrt{N_x})^2} = \\frac{3}{N_x}$), and as far as I'm aware there's no principled reason why PyTorch does this. But the most important thing is that the variance scales as $O(1 / N_x)$, rather than what the exact scaling constant is.\n",

    "* The `to` method is really useful here - it can move objects between different devices (i.e. CPU and GPU) *as well as* changing a tensor's datatype.\n",
    "    * Note that `to` is never inplace for tensors (i.e. you have to call `x = x.to(device)`), but when working with models, calling `model = model.to(device)` or `model.to(device)` are both perfectly valid.\n",
    "* Errors from having one tensor on cpu and another on cuda are very common. Some useful practices to avoid this:\n",
    "    * Throw in assert statements, to make sure tensors are on the same device\n",
    "    * Remember that when you initialise an array (e.g. with `t.zeros` or `t.arange`), it will be on CPU by default.\n",
    "    * Tensor methods like [`new_zeros`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_zeros.html) or [`new_full`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_full.html) are useful, because they'll create tensors which match the device and dtype of the base tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common practice to put a line like this at the top of your file, defining a global variable which you can use in subsequent modules and functions (excluding the print statement):"

This will involve things like creating a `Trainer` class which wraps around our model, and giving it methods like `training_step` and `validation_step` which correspond to different parts of the training loop. This will make it easier to add features like logging and validation, and will also make our code more readable and easier to refactor. However, for now we've kept things simple."

    "Let's break down the important parts of this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The batch size is the number of samples in each batch (i.e. the number of samples we feed into the model at once). While training our model, we differentiate with respect to the average loss over all samples in the batch (so a smaller batch usually means the loss is more noisy). However, if you're working with large models, then often having a batch size too large will result in a memory error. This will be relevant for models later on in the course, but for now we're working with very small models so this isn't an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we get our training set, via the helper function `get_mnist`. This helper function used `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to load in data, and then (optionally) the `torch.utils.data.Subset` function to return a subset of this data. Don't worry about the details of this function, it's not the kind of thing you'll need to know by heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define our optimizer, using `torch.optim.Adam`. The `torch.optim` module gives a wide variety of modules, such as Adam, SGD, and RMSProp. Adam is generally the most popular and seen as the most effective in the majority of cases. We'll discuss optimizers in more detail tomorrow, but for now it's enough to understand that the optimizer calculates the amount to update parameters by (as a function of those parameters' gradients, and sometimes other inputs), and performs this update step. The first argument passed to our optimizer is the parameters of our model (because these are the values that will be updated via gradient descent), and you can also pass keyword arguments to the optimizer which change its behaviour (e.g. the learning rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have the actual training loop. We iterate through our training data, and for each batch we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate our model on the batch of data, to get the logits for our class predictions,\n",
    "2. Calculate the loss between our logits and the true class labels,\n",
    "3. Backpropagate the loss through our model (this step accumulates gradients in our model parameters),\n",
    "4. Step our optimizer, which is what actually updates the model parameters,\n",
    "5. Zero the gradients of our optimizer, ready for the next step."

With this, the formula for $l_n$ reduces to the one we see above (i.e. the mean of the negative log probabilities).\n",

    "\n",
    "* When we say **logits**, we mean the output of the model before applying softmax. We can uniquely define a distribution with a set of logits, just like we can define a distribution with a set of probabilities (and sometimes it's easier to think of a distribution in terms of logits, as we'll see later in the course).\n",
    "\n",
    "* When we say **unnormalized**, we mean the denominator term $\\sum_{c'} \\exp(x_{n, c'})$ isn't necessarily equal to 1. We can add a constant value onto all the logits which makes this term 1 without changing any of the actual probabilities, then we have the relation $p_{n, c} = \\exp(-l_{n, c})$. Here, we call $-l_{n, c}$ the **log probabilities** (or log probs), since $-l_{n, c} = \\log p_{n, c}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes, when we have a lot of different input parameters to our model, it can be helpful to use dataclasses to keep track of them all. Dataclasses are a special kind of class which come with built-in methods for initialising and printing (i.e. no need to define an `__init__` or `__repr__`). Another advantage of using them is autocompletion: when you type in `args.` in VSCode, you'll get a dropdown of all your different dataclass attributes, which can be useful when you've forgotten what you called a variable!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how we might rewrite our training code above using dataclasses. We've wrapped all the training code inside a single argument called `train`, which takes a `SimpleMLPTrainingArgs` object as its only argument."

    "You should spend up to ~20 minutes on this exercise.\n",

    "Edit the `train` function above to include a validation loop. Train your model, making sure you measure the accuracy at the end of each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few tips to help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* During the validation step, you should be measuring **accuracy**, which is defined as **the fraction of correctly classified images**.\n",
    "    * Note that (unlike loss) accuracy should only be logged after you've gone through the whole validation set. This is because your model doesn't update between computing different accuracies, so it doesn't make sense to log all of them separately.\n",
    "* You don't need to convert to probabilities before calculating accuracy (or even to logprobs), because softmax is an order-preserving function.\n",
    "* You can wrap your code in `with t.inference_mode():` to make sure that your model is in inference mode during validation (i.e. gradients don't propagate).\n",
    "    * Note you could also use the decorator `@t.inference_mode()` to do this, if your training loop was a function.\n",
    "* The `get_mnist` function returns both a trainset and a testset. In the `train` function above we only used the first one, but you should use both.\n",
    "* You'll need a dataloader for the testset, just like we did for the trainset. It doesn't matter whether you shuffle the testset or not, because we're not updating our model parameters during validation."

Recall that we briefly came across `nn.Sequential` at the end of the first day, when building our (extremely simple) neural network. As the name suggests, when an `nn.Sequential` is fed an input, it sequentially applies each of its submodules to the input, with the output from one module feeding into the next one.\n",

    "    * When we call `self.parameters()`, this recursively goes through all modules in `self._modules`, and returns the params in those modules. This means we can nest sequentials within sequentials!\n",
    "* The special `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` methods determine behaviour when we get and set modules within the sequential.\n",
    "* The `repr` of the base class `nn.Module` already recursively prints out the submodules, so we don't need to write anything in `extra_repr`.\n",
    "    * To see how this works in practice, try defining a `Sequential` which takes a sequence of modules that you've defined above, and see what it looks like when you print it.\n",

You'll be using libraries like `einops`, and functions like `torch.as_strided` to get a very low-level picture of how these operations work, which will help build up your overall understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `torch.as_strided` isn't something which will come up explicitly in much of the rest of the course (unlike `einops`). The purpose of the stride exercises is more to give you an appreciation for what's going on under the hood, so that we can build layers of abstraction on top of that during the rest of this week (and by extension this course). I see this as analogous to how [many CS courses](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) start by teaching you about languages like C and concepts like pointers and memory management before moving on to higher-level langauges like Python which abstract away these details. The hope is that when you get to the later sections of the course, you'll have the tools to understand them better."

Commonly, powers of 2 are chosen for computational efficiency, and deeper layers might have more channels to capture complex features.

    "Now that you've seen how to build a modular training loop, and you've seen how ResNet works and is built, we're going to put these two things together to finetune a ResNet model on a new dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finetuning** can mean slightly different things in different contexts, but broadly speaking it means using the weights of an already trained network as the starting values for training a new network. Because training networks from scratch is very computationally expensive, this is a common practice in ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific type of finetuning we'll be doing here is called **feature extraction**. This is when we freeze most layers of a model except the last few, and perform gradient descent on those. We call this feature extraction because the earlier layers of the model have already learned to identify important features of the data (and these features are also relevant for the new task), so all that we have to do is train a few final layers in the model to extract these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Terminology note - sometimes feature extraction and finetuning are defined differently, with finetuning referring to the training of all the weights in a pretrained model (usually with a small or decaying learning rate), and feature extraction referring to the freezing of some layers and training of others. To avoid confusion here, we'll use the term \"feature extraction\" rather than \"finetuning\".*\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll discuss freezing layers & the backpropagation algorithm in much more detail tomorrow, but for now it's fine to just understand what's going on at a basic level. When we call `loss.backward()` in our training loop (or when this is implicitly called by our PyTorch Lightning trainer), this propagates gradients from our `loss` scalar back to all parameters in our model. If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.\n",
